I'm [John Nadeau](http://johnnadeau.me) and I write code for [QueueDr](http://queuedr.com). 
After nearly four years of working in the .NET stack, I've moved on and hopped on the train with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/).
Off the keyboard you can find me skiing in the winter, hiking in the summer, and 
acting like I'm committed to training for triathlon year round (I swear I'm getting
back on track!).
