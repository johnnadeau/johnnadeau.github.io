I'm [John Nadeau]({{ site.url }}) and I write code for [QueueDr][1]. After
nearly four years of working in the .NET stack, I've moved on and hopped on the
train with [Ruby on Rails][2]. Off the keyboard you can find me skiing in the
winter, hiking in the summer, and acting like I'm committed to training for
triathlon year round (I swear I'm getting back on track!). 

If you'd like to chat, feel free to [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}) me or
reach out to me on twitter: [@{{ site.twitter_username }}][2]. I also share
some of my code on [github][4].
