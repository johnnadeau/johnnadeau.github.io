Never stop improving, tweaking, and assessing your development
process. I think we often get stuck in a certain setup and *fear* changing it.
For example, I often find myself using my mouse while in vim even though I know
I shouldn't. I know I could easily disable the use of the mouse in my .vimrc,
but I *fear* it will slow down my flow. That's bullshit. I should take the time
to learn my tools and improve my skills on a daily basis, not just when it's
convenient. It's never going to be convenient. So, improve now and never stop.
