One of my [goals]({% post_url 2014-12-30-a-look-back-at-2014 %}) for this year has been to work on
being more productive. It's really easy to get swooped up in all the productivity books, apps, and
podcasts all while not actually getting anything done! 

Here are the things I've done already to actually fulfil that goal:

###Wake up earlier
I've found the first few hours of the day I can get a whole lot more done than the later hours of
the day. Even if I don't, I get all the potentially useless crap out of the way(twitter, hackernews,
etc). An added bonus here is this has been making it much easier for me to get to the gym and 
exercise.

###Work in different places
I've split my time lately working on the couch, my desk at home, and at the 
[coworking space](http://www.haverhillcoworking.com/). I'm likely going to remove the couch from
that equation, but it's been nice to be somewhere else in my house getting things done. Plus, the
couch, most likely, isn't the best thing for my back and posture.

###Have a clear workspace
My desk needs to be clean! At home this can be a challenge, but elsewhere I can't store all my junk
so it saves me the hassle of cleaning when I head to the coworking space!

###Have a clear mind
This is a tough one for me, but I've found a solution! I simply started writing all my ideas,
tasks, and everything down. Either in my calendar on my phone or [Evernote](http://evernote.com).
I've particularly grown fond of the *reminder* feature on Evernote for simple things I need to 
remember for today(like mailing out a bill that somehow doesn't have online billpay...). This frees
up my mind to focus on whatever task I *need* to be focusing on right now.

These things are baby steps in the right direction. I'm hoping as this month closes out I can
improve on my planning and scheduling. I really would like to be able to start a small side
project I've had on the backburner, so having my day/week/month/year planned out will help me
manage my time appropriately.
