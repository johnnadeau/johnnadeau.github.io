Earlier this month I founded my first meetup group, the 
[Haverhill Hackers](http://www.meetup.com/haverhillhackers/)!
Coming up tomorrow we'll have our first official meetup at the 
[Essex Innovation Lab](http://www.haverhillcoworking.com).

##Why start a *"hacking"* meetup in Haverhill?

 Well, for starters, I'm lazy! I don't
really feel like making my way into Boston to attend meetups. I know I'm not
alone either(and the now 41 members who have joined show this). Additionally,
I live and work in this area and it's going to be a wonderful opportunity to
get to know other developers.

##Why start your own meetup?
As a *mostly* solo developer, I find myself hitting road blocks in my work
that I know I could easily hash out talking to a fellow developer. Starting
this meetup just increased the amount of developers I can bounce ideas and 
problems off of. 

I am far from a public speaker or a great leader, I'm taking this as an 
opportunity to get better in that realm. Communication is key as remote
worker!

###Sound interesting?

If you're in the area, feel free to join the
[Haverhill Hackers](http://www.meetup.com/haverhillhackers/). If you're not,
you can still get in touch with me to chat. You can find me on
[twitter](http://twitter.com/johnnadeau) or [email me](mailto:{{ site.email }})!
