I've been working at [QueueDr](http://queuedr.com) for around two months now! Since I'm located in Massachusetts, I've continued
to work remotely from my home office. While I enjoy kicking it around the house most days, I find myself getting caught up in
house work and other distractions every so often. To combat this, I wanted to start getting out of the house any chance I could
get. One issue there, my options _were_ quite limited. I have a coffee shop in town, but I wanted to get in a more collaborative
space. Thankfully, I got word of a co-working space opening up in Haverhill this month. It's 
a short (< 10 minute) drive, has great workspace options, and is in a nice location where I can take a quick walk to grab a coffee.
Since it just opened this month the space has been on the empty side, but I'm sure that'll change soon. I hope it'll mature into
that collaborative environment I'm looking for. If you're in the Haverhill area be sure to come check the 
[Essex Innovation Lab](http://www.haverhillcoworking.com/) out.

_PS. Expect to hear from me more frequently in the future. Now that I'm situated and comfortable in my new position, I'm ready to 
spend some more time writing._
