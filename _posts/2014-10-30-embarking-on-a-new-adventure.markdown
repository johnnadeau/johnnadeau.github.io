Hi! Welcome to attempt number two at getting a blog going! I always feel like
my brain is clouded with too many thoughts and I never really get them out in
a way I'd like to(or they never escape my head and disappear). This will be 
the place where I get all those thoughts out and hopefully we can all learn
something in the process.

## Who am I?

I'm [John Nadeau](http://johnnadeau.me) and I write code for [QueueDr](http://queuedr.com). After nearly four years of working in the .NET stack, I've moved on and hopped on the train with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/).
Off the keyboard you can find me skiing in the winter, hiking in the summer, and 
acting like I'm committed to training for triathlon year round (I swear I'm getting
back on track!).
