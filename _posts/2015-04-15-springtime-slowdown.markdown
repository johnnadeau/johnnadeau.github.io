So, an interesting thing has been happening to me lately and it seems to happen
every year. The weather gets nice and my desire to be inside diminishes. As much
as I enjoy coding, I just as much would love to hit the road for a bike ride or
run. This isn't even counting the hours of yard work staring at me out the
window. 

*How do I keep myself focused when I need to and enjoy the outdoors when I want
to?* 

To be honest, I don't know yet! I'm actually sitting here thinking of how I can
improve here. As I always seem to do, I'll start a list...

##Spring (Productivity) Cleaning

1. **Get my workouts scheduled** and schedule them in the morning or around
lunch to give myself a break in my day. This will keep workouts off my mind and
stop me from skipping a workout because I have work to do (or putting off work
because I have a workout to do).
2. **Wake up earlier!**  More work done in the morning means more time in the
afternoon/evening to myself. *This is an ongoing battle for me.*
3. **Reevaluate my productivity tools/usage.** Right now, I have a rather
relaxed approach to my [Trello](http://www.trello.com) board. I'd like to focus
my cards more and have a better prioritizing of tasks. I want to make sure a
card represents a few hours work and that I can easily see my progress and what
needs to be done next.

These three things should set me up to crush work and enjoy the outdoors on a
daily basis. Now that I look at them, they're all obvious things I should have
been doing anyways. Time to get out of this slowdown and get back on track.
